# 🧠 ResumeMatch AI

A smart, dual-purpose machine learning project that empowers **job seekers** and **recruiters** with intelligent, automated resume-job matching.

---

## 🚀 Overview

**ResumeMatch AI** is an ML-powered system that does two things:

- 🎯 Helps **candidates** find the most relevant job listings based on their resume.
- 🧑‍💼 Helps **recruiters** rank and filter a pool of resumes based on how well they match a specific job description.

Whether you're applying or hiring, ResumeMatch AI works both ways, all powered by a unified vector similarity engine under the hood.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Traditional job applications are inefficient — resumes are often overlooked, and job seekers apply blindly to roles. Recruiters, on the other hand, must manually sift through large stacks of resumes to find a match.

**This project solves both problems:**
- For job seekers: It suggests the most suitable job listings.
- For employers: It filters and ranks resumes based on relevance to a job posting.

  - **Output:** Ranked list of candidate resumes that best fit the role
