## ‚ú® Features

This project offers a dual-interface system catering to both job applicants and recruiters.

### For the Applicant:
* **Find Your Fit**: Upload your resume in `.pdf`, `.docx`, or `.txt` format.
* **Get Instant Matches**: The system analyzes your resume and matches it against a database of 147 unique job titles.
* **Dual Model Power**: Choose between a fast, baseline **TF-IDF** model or a more accurate, semantically-aware **BERT** model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) for your results.

### For the Recruiter:
* **Efficient Candidate Sourcing**: Upload a single job description and a batch of multiple candidate resumes.
* **Automated Ranking**: The system ranks all submitted resumes based on their relevance to the job description, saving hours of manual review.
* **Flexible Analysis**: Leverage either the TF-IDF or the advanced BERT model to score and rank your talent pool.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

This application is built using a modern, decoupled, client-server architecture, ensuring scalability and maintainability.



* **Frontend**: A user-friendly and interactive web interface built with **Streamlit**. It is responsible for all user interactions and visualizations.
* **Backend**: A high-performance, robust RESTful API built with **FastAPI**. It handles all the heavy lifting, including text processing, model inference, and the core matching logic.
* **Communication**: The frontend communicates with the backend via standard HTTP requests, sending data as JSON payloads.
* **Model Hosting**: All machine learning artifacts (models, vectorizers, and data) are hosted on the **Hugging Face Hub**, keeping the application code lightweight and portable.
